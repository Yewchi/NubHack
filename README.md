## NubHack - 3.7 But harder

I love NetHack, it's one of the best video games ever made. And I love 3.7.

But it's too easy for me to enjoy (I'm spoilerless noob).

So I've reversed some of the sanity-commits that made the game even slightly playable.

This is just a fork for me, or anyone who wants a slightly more difficult 3.7 wizard, branching from December 2023.

I'm aware of most of the things I've removed, but my target for reverts is strategically guided by avoiding spoilers... that is.. I'm skim-reading code based on knowledge of balance decisions made, and avoiding spoilers while targetting commits I expect will make the game easier.
