# NubHack - 3.7, but harder

_This is not a real variant and the name is free_

### Compat

build env is made for linux install, and coexisting with offical NetHack with a safe `make install`. Compiles exe @ src/nubhack.

It might build for Mac, but I can't guarentee it won't overwrite your NH 3.7 save file, or work at all, or not install to the wrong folder, or not have broken config paths.

It will defintely overwrite any savefile on Windows, and remove previous installs as it is.

### Reasoning

I love NetHack, I agree that it's one of the best video games ever made. And I love 3.7.

But it's too easy compared with recent development versions for me to enjoy (I'm a spoilerless noob).

So I've reversed some of the sanity-commits that made the early game breezy. I just like silly game overs. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

This is just a fork for me, or anyone who wants a slightly more difficult 3.7 wizard, branching from December 2023.

I'm aware of most of the things I've removed, other things I don't even know what I did, but my target for reverts is strategically guided by avoiding spoilers... that is.. I'm skim-reading code based on knowledge of balance decisions made, and avoiding spoilers while targetting commits I expect will make the game easier. A deeper reading just spoils the fun until after I ascend.
